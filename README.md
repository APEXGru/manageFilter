# manageFilter
Adding and deleting a Filter to an Interactive Grid. 
This Plugin can be used a starting point to build more a better user experience for the Interactive Grid.
The value to filter on should be stored in a Page Item on Page 0, so it can be accessed from each and every page.
You have to add code yourself to actually set and unset that Page Item value.
